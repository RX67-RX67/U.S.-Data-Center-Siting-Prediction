# U.S.-Data-Center-Siting-Prediction
This project revises and extends a previous course project, aiming to collect county-level data from U.S. government sources and develop a predictive model. The objective is to identify the factors that influence the siting of data centers across counties and to assess the potential for counties to attract such infrastructure.
