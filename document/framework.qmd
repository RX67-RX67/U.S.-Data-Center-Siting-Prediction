# Part I: Introduction

### Background

AI infrastructure has become an increasingly important area of investment for countries with ambitions in the field. Beyond basic infrastructure such as electricity and network capacity, one of the most critical types of infrastructure for AI development is the AI data center. 

The aim of this project is to analyze county-level data gathered from government websites to identify potential factors that determine whether a county is suitable for AI development. This analysis provides companies and policymakers with practical recommendations on whether and where to invest in today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape.

### What Makes a Data Center an AI Data Center – Location Factors

Some factors related to the location selection of an AI data center can be summarized as follows (IBM, *What is an AI Data Center*, 2025 Feb):

- **Large physical space requirements**: An AI data center is designed to host a large number of GPUs and supporting infrastructure, which occupy significant physical space. Counties that can offer large areas at low cost may attract more investment.

- **High electricity consumption**: The training of AI models significantly increases electricity demand. Counties that can provide reliable and affordable electricity may be preferred locations.

- **Need for efficient cooling systems**: As the demand for cooling infrastructure increases, efficient cooling solutions are becoming more important. Areas that offer innovative or cost-effective cooling options may have a competitive advantage.

### The Selected Companies - Major Players

The companies selected for generating positive samples in this project are leading players in the technology industry. However, it should be noted that not all companies publicly disclose the exact locations of their data centers.

* Microsoft
* Google
* AWS
* IBM
* Meta
* Oracle
* Equinix 
* Digital Realty

### Why County-Level Data

This project chose to use county-level data due to its balance between granularity and availability. Compared to city-level data, county-level data is generally more comprehensive, more accessible, and still retains sufficient spatial resolution for meaningful analysis.

### Raw Features Selection and Explanation

![](../images/raw_features.jpeg)
Feature selection was guided in part by Kearney’s *AI Data Center Location Attractiveness Index* (2025).

This project uses data from the year 2023 as a temporal baseline, which aligns with the objective of identifying the key determinants of AI data center siting at the county level.

The timing is also contextually relevant: since late 2022, the launch of ChatGPT and subsequent developments in generative AI have led to a rapid acceleration in AI adoption and investment, including substantial expansion in the demand for AI-specific infrastructure such as data centers.

- **Operational Cost**:
- **Electricity Price**: [Visit Data Source](https://data.openei.org/submissions/6225)
- **Labor Cost**: [Visit Data Source](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm)
- **Land Price**: [Visit Data Source](https://www.aei.org/housing/land-price-indicators/)

- **Infrastructure Readiness**:
- **Max Network Bandwidth**: This feature represents the highest potential broadband capacity in a county. It is calculated by combining the maximum advertised download and upload speeds reported by all internet service providers operating in that county. Since multiple providers may be available, we use the highest recorded speeds to approximate the best possible network infrastructure accessible within the county. However, this feature is kept for further consideration given that, it may represent duplicative information with the high speed internet covergae rate and it's difficult to obtain.
- **High-SPPED Internet Coverage Rate**: This feature represents the coverage rate of high speed Internet (download >= 250mbps; upload >= 25mbps) of different counties. Instead of considering the rate for residential building, this research uses the rate for business purpose building.
